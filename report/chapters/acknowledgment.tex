        We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Prof. Sebastian Houben for delivering the course ``Deep Learning for Robot Vision", which provided us the essential knowledge to complete this project as well as his feedback for our work.
        
        We are also grateful to Institue for Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous Systems (A2S), Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg for providing us with the computational resources. The cluster had been instrumental in facilitating the implementation and evaluation of our project.

        Furthermore, we would like to appreciate the organizer of the Image Matching Challenge 2025 and the platform Kaggle for their effort in hosting the competition and make the dataset accessible to the community.
